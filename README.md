# BasicStringCalc
School Project.

This project is created as a TDD-exercise.
unfortunatly, when done, and to add new tests, the test class became unstable and got an error.

However, the program is able to run, but not the tests at this stage.

Problem solved...
Junit 4.12 was the problem.
problem solved when merged Junit 4.10 to the project
